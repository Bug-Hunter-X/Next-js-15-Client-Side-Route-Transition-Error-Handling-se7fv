# Next.js 15 Client-Side Route Transition Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered in Next.js 15 applications related to client-side route transitions and error handling.  Specifically, if a component unexpectedly throws an error during a transition, Next.js may not handle it gracefully by default.

## The Problem

The `pages/about.js` component intentionally throws an error.  When navigating to this page, Next.js 15 might crash or display a less than user-friendly error message.

## The Solution

The solution involves implementing proper error boundaries within your Next.js application to gracefully handle these exceptions, providing a better user experience.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Navigate to `/about` in your browser. You'll see the default Next.js error page if you do not implement the solution.
